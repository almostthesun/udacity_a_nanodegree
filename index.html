 <b>1. The Web.<br>
 2. HTML.<br>
 3. URLs.<br>
 4. HTTP.<br>
 5. Web Applications.</b>
<p>
 <b>1. WWW</b> (invented around 1990s)<br> is a collection of HTML documents. <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and is the main type of content on the WWW.<br><br>
  <b><em>HOW IT WORKS</em></b><br><br>
 This system of Internet servers supports specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in the abovementioned language called HTML that supports links to other documents, as well as images, music and video files, pdfs and etc. This means you we can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots.<br><br>
 <u>Browsers</u>, <u>the Internet</u>, <u>HTTP protocol</u> and <u>Servers</u> are the major pieces that make up the WWW.<br><br><b>BROWSER</b> - a program that runs on a computer to display files found on the Web.<br>
<b>THE INTERNET</b> - the world's largest computer network.<br>
<b>HTTP</b> - the main protocol of the Web<br>
<b>SERVERS</b> - computers that host what make up the Web.

<h2>HTML Markup</h2>
HTML markup consists of several key components, including <b>tags and their attributes</b>, character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come <b>in pairs</b>. Some of them however are called <b>VOID</b> tags as they represent empty elements and so are unpaired. The first tag in such a pair is <b>the opening tag</b>, and the second is <b>the closing tag</b>.<br>

<h2>Stupid Computers</h2>
To make the first step to successful programing experience one needs to understand that computers are stupid. That is because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them quite unforgiving since even a small typo by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

<p>
<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an <em>"invisible box"</em> around the content inside of them.
